# Appendix 2: Modern C++ Best Practices

In this appendix we will briefly talk about the best practices of modern C++. In general, the author's thoughts on C++'s best practices are mainly absorbed from [Effective Modern C++](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1491903996/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_U_-ZgjDb81ERBNP) and [C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html). In this appendix, we will briefly discuss and use the actual examples to illustrate the methods, and introduce some of **the author's personal**, **non-common**, **non-sensible** best practices, and how to ensure the overall quality of the code.
