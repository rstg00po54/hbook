# Appendix 1: Further Study Materials

First of all, congratulations ðŸŽ‰ on reading this book! I hope this book has raised your interest in modern C++.

As mentioned in the introduction to this book, this book is just a book that takes you quickly to the new features of modern C++ 11/14/17/20, rather than the advanced learning practice of C++ "Black Magic". The author of course also thinks about this demand, but the content is very difficult and there are few audiences. Here, the author lists some materials that can help you learn more about modern C++ based on this book. I hope I can help you:

- [C++ Reference](https://en.cppreference.com/w)
- [CppCon YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/CppCon/videos)
- [Ulrich Drepper. What Every Programmer Should Know About Memory. 2007](https://people.freebsd.org/~lstewart/articles/cpumemory.pdf)
- to be added
